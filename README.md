Unsupervised Underwater Image Restoration: From a Homology Perspective. Accepted by AAAI 2022 [paper](https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-2078.FuZ.pdf).

To test our method, you can run eval.py using our pretrained model in ./final_weight.

To train the model, you need to prepare the [dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBCXCa5GWJPB7S6xO7f0N562FqXhsV6c/view?usp=sharing) first. Then run main.py.
